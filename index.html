        <h1 class="title">CSS Rothko</h1>
        <p class="rothko">One of the preeminent artists of his generation, Mark Rothko is closely identified with the
            New York school, a circle of painters that emerged during the 1940s as a new collective voice in American
            art. During a career that spanned five decades, he created a new and impassioned form of abstract painting.

            Rothko's work is characterized by rigorous attention to formal elements such as color, shape, balance,
            depth, composition, and scale; yet, he refused to consider his paintings solely in these terms. He
            explained: "It is a widely accepted notion among painters that it does not matter what one paints as long as
            it is well painted. This is the essence of academicism. There is no such thing as good painting about
            nothing."</p>
